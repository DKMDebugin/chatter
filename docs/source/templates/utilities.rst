Utilities
=========

Some utilities would be nice to have integrated with Chatter.
For example, we could have the following:

* A module that takes in a list of :code:`User` objects and creates
  a room with them in it.
* Multitenancy middleware specifically for routing to Chatter
  along with the :code:`User` object.
